synopsis:           Accelerated version of ghc --make
description:
    The @ghc-make@ program can be used as an alternative to @ghc --make@. When the build has some
    work to do it will perform slower than @ghc --make@ alone. When there is no work to do, the build
    will run faster, sometimes significantly so.
