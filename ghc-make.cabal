synopsis:           Accelerated version of ghc --make
description:
    The @ghc-make@ program can be used as a drop-in replacement for @ghc@. This program
    targets two use cases:
    .
    * If a flag such as @-j4@ is passed, the modules will be compiled in parallel.
    If the available parallelism is greater than a factor of 3, the build will probably run faster.
    .
    * If there is no work to do (i.e. the compiled files are up-to-date), the build will run faster,
    sometimes significantly so.
    .
